# Spotify Listening Data Analysis
##  Project Objective
The objective was to design a comprehensive and interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze user engagement with music content on Spotify. The goal was to uncover listening patterns across albums, artists, and tracks to assist in understanding user behavior and content performance over time.

##  Tools Used
Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling | Interactive Visuals

##  Dataset Overview
The dataset included detailed track-level data such as timestamps, platforms used, playback duration, artist and album information, listening behaviors (start/end reasons), and playback settings (shuffle/skipped).

##  Key KPIs and Business Questions Addressed
- What are the trends in albums, artists, and tracks played over time?
- Which year had the highest and lowest engagement across albums, artists, and tracks?
- What are the listening patterns across weekdays and weekends?
- Who are the top 5 most played artists, albums, and tracks?
- How does the current year compare to the previous year in terms of engagement?
- What are the peak hours for user listening activity?
= How does listening time relate to track frequency (engagement quadrant analysis)?
- How do users interact with shuffle mode and track skipping?

##  Process & Implementation
- Conducted business requirement gathering and data walkthrough to define objectives.
- Connected and cleaned raw Spotify data, handling inconsistencies and missing values.
- Modeled relationships among albums, tracks, and artists for interactive navigation.
- Created DAX measures for YoY growth, listening duration, frequency categories, and top performers.
- Built interactive dashboards with drill-down, drill-through, and hierarchy-based navigation.
- Used visualizations including heatmaps, scatter plots, bar charts, and detail grids to uncover patterns.
- Integrated slicers and export-ready reports for deeper analysis and usability.

- Mobile and desktop platforms saw the highest streaming activity.
- Weekends had noticeably higher engagement, with peak hours in the late evening.
- Heatmap analysis showed consistent listening behavior across certain days and hours.
- Users frequently engaged with tracks manually, showing strong intentional listening patterns.
- Shuffle mode usage was moderate, indicating preference for sequential or curated play.

##  Final Outcome
Delivered a dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard that enables in-depth analysis of Spotify listening behavior. This project empowers stakeholders to understand content consumption trends, user engagement levels, and performance across different timeframes and platforms.
